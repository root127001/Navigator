This is the first script i make.
The script gives you information about special directories and navigates you to the directory you choose.
This may be useless to you but I thought i'd make it anyways and improve my skills,maybe this could help new people into learning more about the directories.

For this script to work you must use:

root@Kali:~# source Navigator.sh
